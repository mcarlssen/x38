"""
Custom Harbor docker environment that disables the deploy.resources.limits block.

In a Docker-in-Docker setup running on cgroup v2 in "domain threaded" mode,
trying to apply CPU/memory limits via `deploy.resources.limits` triggers:

    cannot enter cgroupv2 "/sys/fs/cgroup/docker" with domain controllers
    -- it is in threaded mode

This subclass writes a small compose override file that resets the limits to
empty so docker compose accepts the configuration without trying to set
unsupported cgroup controllers.
