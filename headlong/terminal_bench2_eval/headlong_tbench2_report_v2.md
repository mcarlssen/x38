## Failing Tasks — Timeouts (37)

These tasks ran until harbor's agent timeout killed them. Many are extremely hard (expert time estimates of 30-120 minutes).

## Failing Tasks — Wrong Answers (16)

These tasks completed but the verifier rejected the output.

## Impact of the [cmd] Context Fix

The context rendering fix (PR #8) completely eliminated the `[cmd]` marker bug:

| Metric | Before fix | After fix |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| [cmd] iteration waste | 62.7% | 0% |
| Effective iterations | ~37% of budget | 100% of budget |
| Pass rate | 35% (partial) | 40.4% (full) |

Every iteration now executes real code instead of aborting on `[cmd]: command not found`.

## Recommendations

### High Impact

1. **Increase agent timeouts.** 37 of 53 failures (70%) were timeouts. Many tasks need more time, especially complex ones like path-tracing (1800s timeout) and regex-chess (3600s). Consider 2x default timeouts.

2. **Reduce effort for early iterations.** With effort=max, each LLM call takes 30-60s of thinking. The first few exploratory iterations (ls, pwd, cat) don't need this. Using effort=high for the first 5 iterations would save ~3 minutes per task.

3. **Better error recovery prompts.** 16 tasks produced wrong answers. Adding a self-verification step ("run the test suite before setting FINAL") could catch some of these.

### Medium Impact

4. **Task-specific skills.** The installed skills (mem, web-research, file-tools, skill-author) are general-purpose. Task-specific skills for common patterns (git recovery, build debugging, ML training) could help.

5. **Retry with different strategy on timeout.** When a task times out, retrying with a completely different approach (instead of continuing the same strategy) might help. The max-retries=1 setting should help but retries also time out on the same hard tasks.

6. **Pre-install common tools.** Many tasks need git, python3, build-essential. The setup phase installs these but it takes ~30s per task. Pre-baking them into the Docker image would save time.
