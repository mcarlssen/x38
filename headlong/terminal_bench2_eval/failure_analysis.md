### Detailed Analysis by Task

---

#### 1. adaptive-rejection-sampler (900s, 23 iterations)

**Task:** Implement an adaptive rejection sampler in R per Gilks et al. (1992), with formal testing.

**What happened:** Headlong spent most of its time in extended thinking/reasoning about the mathematical details of the ARS algorithm -- numerical stability of the sampling function, log-concavity checks, segment area computation, and edge cases. By iteration 23, it was still working through the mathematical derivation in its thinking block rather than writing and testing code. The thinking was correct and sophisticated (handling numerical stability via log-space arithmetic, boundary conditions, etc.) but it never finished writing the actual implementation.

**Diagnosis:** Thinking loop -- too much reasoning, not enough code execution. The model got caught in an extended chain-of-thought about mathematical edge cases without committing to an implementation.

**How close:** Not close. The implementation was still being designed in the model's reasoning.

---

#### 2. build-cython-ext (900s, 20 iterations)

**Task:** Compile pyknotid Cython extensions for NumPy 2.3.0 compatibility.

**What happened:** The agent was actively working on cloning pyknotid, modifying Cython files for NumPy 2.0+ compatibility, and rebuilding. The last iteration was still reading the prompt context (the log shows the prompt being printed), suggesting the model had a context issue or was being slow on API calls.

**Diagnosis:** Slow progress -- the task involves compilation and debugging of Cython build issues which takes real time for each iteration.

**How close:** Moderate progress but not done.

---

#### 3. caffe-cifar-10 (1200s, 64 iterations)

**Task:** Build BVLC Caffe 1.0.0 from source and train CIFAR-10 CNN for 500 iterations.

**What happened:** The agent successfully built Caffe and was in the process of preparing CIFAR-10 data and training. At timeout, it was checking build artifacts and data files. The training itself (500 iterations of CNN training) is computationally expensive.

**Diagnosis:** Inherently slow task -- building Caffe from source and training a CNN both take significant wall-clock time. 64 iterations shows steady progress.

**How close:** Close -- build was complete, data was prepared, but training likely hadn't finished.

---

#### 4. chess-best-move (900s, 42 iterations)

**Task:** Identify the best chess move from an image of a chess board (chess_board.png).

**What happened:** The agent spent extensive time trying to identify chess pieces from pixel-level analysis of the PNG image. It was analyzing piece shapes (rook patterns, king cross shape, pawn profiles) but struggled to definitively identify all pieces. The last iteration was still reasoning about piece identification and getting confused about which pieces were bishops vs pawns.

**Diagnosis:** Stuck analyzing -- the task requires visual recognition of chess pieces, and the agent was attempting this through programmatic pixel analysis rather than having native image understanding, leading to an identification loop.

**How close:** Not close. Still trying to identify the board position.

---

#### 5. circuit-fibsqrt (3600s, 23 iterations -- EMPTY API LOOP)

**Task:** Create a logic-gate file (<32K lines) that computes fib(isqrt(N)) mod 2^32.

**What happened:** After 23 productive iterations, the API started returning empty responses. The agent retried 735 times (retries 1-736) with no content returned, burning the entire remaining timeout on empty response retries.

**Diagnosis:** **API empty response bug.** The model stopped producing responses (possibly due to context length issues or an API-side problem), and the retry loop consumed all remaining time.

**How close:** Unknown -- 23 iterations of progress but it's unclear how far along the logic gate design was.

---

#### 6. cobol-modernization (900s, 29 iterations)

**Task:** Re-implement a COBOL program in Python that reads INPUT.DAT and modifies .DAT files.

**What happened:** The agent analyzed the COBOL program, understood the record structures (accounts, books, transactions), and was actively writing the Python reimplementation. At timeout, it was mid-way through writing the `main()` function that handles input validation and file operations.

**Diagnosis:** Steady progress but ran out of time. The COBOL analysis and Python rewrite are both time-consuming.

**How close:** Fairly close -- the Python program was being written with correct logic but wasn't completed.

---

#### 7. count-dataset-tokens (900s, 38 iterations)

**Task:** Count tokens in a HuggingFace dataset (OpenThoughts-1k-sample).

**What happened:** The agent was downloading and analyzing the dataset but got confused about the dataset structure (default subset vs metadata subset). It was spending iterations trying to understand the dataset organization rather than counting tokens.

**Diagnosis:** Slow progress due to dataset confusion. Downloading from HuggingFace also consumed significant time.

**How close:** Moderate -- dataset was loaded but token counting may not have been completed.

---

#### 8. crack-7z-hash (900s, 45 iterations)

**Task:** Crack a 7z archive password and extract the secret word.

**What happened:** The agent was attempting various approaches to crack the 7z password. At iteration 45, it was still reading the prompt context, suggesting it may have been in a slow API response cycle.

**Diagnosis:** Computationally hard task -- password cracking requires brute force or dictionary attacks which are time-consuming.

**How close:** Unknown -- depends on whether the password was found before timeout.

---

#### 9. custom-memory-heap-crash (1800s, 80 iterations)

**Task:** Fix a C++ program that crashes in RELEASE mode but not DEBUG mode due to custom heap issues.

**What happened:** The agent made excellent progress. It identified the root cause: the custom libstdc++ implementation allocates `_Fac_node` objects when `std::cout` is first used, and in RELEASE mode these are allocated from the custom heap. When the program exits, the custom heap is destroyed first, and the facet cleanup tries to delete from already-freed memory. The agent identified the fix (pre-warm facet registration before the custom heap is set up) but ran out of time implementing it.

**Diagnosis:** Steady progress -- deep debugging took many iterations. The agent correctly diagnosed the issue.

**How close:** Very close -- root cause found, solution identified, just needed implementation.

---

#### 10. dna-assembly (1800s, 38 iterations)

**Task:** Design primers for Golden Gate assembly of DNA fragments (input plasmid, egfp, flag, snap).

**What happened:** The agent was deeply engaged in the molecular biology of BsaI Golden Gate assembly, working through the primer design math: computing 4-nt overhangs at junction sites, designing forward/reverse primers with correct BsaI recognition sites, and calculating annealing regions. At timeout, it was still working through the primer tail design logic.

**Diagnosis:** Thinking loop -- the agent spent too much time reasoning about the molecular biology details rather than computing and writing primers.

**How close:** Moderate -- the design was being worked out but primers weren't finalized.

---

#### 11. extract-elf (900s, 22 iterations)

**Task:** Write extract.js that reads memory values from a compiled C binary (ELF) and outputs JSON.

**What happened:** The agent was analyzing the ELF binary structure using readelf/objdump and testing the binary behavior. It was working on understanding how to map ELF sections to memory addresses.

**Diagnosis:** Steady progress but complex task. ELF parsing requires careful understanding of section headers and load addresses.

**How close:** Moderate -- approach was correct but implementation not complete.

---

#### 12. extract-moves-from-video (1800s, 53 iterations)

**Task:** Download a YouTube video of Zork gameplay and transcribe all player moves.

**What happened:** The agent downloaded the video, extracted 760 frames, cropped them to the text area, and was running OCR (tesseract) on each frame in parallel. The OCR processing of 760 frames was very slow.

**Diagnosis:** Inherently slow task -- video download, frame extraction, and OCR of 760 frames takes significant wall-clock time.

**How close:** Moderate -- frames were extracted and OCR was running but results weren't fully processed.

---

#### 13. feal-linear-cryptanalysis (1800s, 26 iterations)

**Task:** Perform linear cryptanalysis on a FEAL-like cipher to recover the key.

**What happened:** The agent wrote and compiled a C attack program, verified it matched the reference encryption function, but hit a bash syntax error at the end of iteration 26. The attack implementation was in progress.

**Diagnosis:** Steady progress -- the cryptanalysis approach was correct and code was being written.

**How close:** Moderate -- attack code compiled but key recovery wasn't complete.

---

#### 14. filter-js-from-html (1800s, 45 iterations -- AGENT+VERIFIER TIMEOUT)

**Task:** Create /app/filter.py that removes JavaScript from HTML to prevent XSS.

**What happened:** The agent **successfully completed the task** and set FINAL with a comprehensive solution at iteration 44. The trial.log notes "Verifier execution timed out after 900.0 seconds", while the exception.txt records the overall agent timeout at 1800s. The agent finished its work, but the verifier's tests took too long to run, and the overall harbor trial timed out.

**Diagnosis:** **Verifier timeout caused the overall failure.** The agent's solution was complete and FINAL was set. The verifier's test suite exceeded its own 900s timeout, which then contributed to the overall 1800s agent timeout. This is a verifier infrastructure issue, not an agent capability issue.

**How close:** Task was completed -- the agent produced a working solution.

---

#### 15. fix-ocaml-gc (3600s, 103 iterations)

**Task:** Fix a broken OCaml garbage collector (run-length compressed free space in major heap) so compiler bootstraps and basic tests pass.

**What happened:** The agent was repeatedly building the OCaml compiler (which takes a long time per build). At 103 iterations over 3600s, each iteration averaged ~35 seconds, much of which was build time. The agent had successfully built `ocamlc` and `ocamlopt` but was still working on getting tests to pass.

**Diagnosis:** Inherently slow builds -- each compile cycle of the OCaml compiler consumes significant time. 103 iterations shows the agent was actively working.

**How close:** Compiler built but tests not yet passing cleanly.

---

#### 16. git-leak-recovery (900s, 22 iterations)

**Task:** Recover a secret from git history, write to secret.txt, then clean up the repo.

**What happened:** The agent found the secret blob (52d18a091cd...) in the reflog via `git ls-tree` of the old commit tree. It was on the verge of recovering the content and cleaning up the repo.

**Diagnosis:** Steady progress -- the investigation was methodical and correct.

**How close:** Very close -- the secret was located, just needed to extract and clean.

---

#### 17. gpt2-codegolf (900s, 30 iterations)

**Task:** Write a <5000-byte C program that loads GPT-2 124M weights from a .ckpt file and does argmax inference.

**What happened:** The agent spent all 30 iterations reasoning about the checkpoint format, weight ordering, BPE tokenization, and inference implementation without writing the actual C code. It got deep into the GPT-2 tokenizer details (bytes_to_unicode mapping, BPE merge algorithm, hash tables for pair lookups).

**Diagnosis:** Thinking loop -- the model did extensive architectural reasoning but never committed to writing code.

**How close:** Not close -- still in the design/reasoning phase.

---

#### 18. headless-terminal (900s, 30 iterations)

**Task:** Implement the BaseTerminal interface for a headless terminal with PTY.

**What happened:** The agent implemented the terminal using PTY (pseudo-terminal) and verified it could execute commands, read output, and handle Ctrl-C. Testing showed correct behavior (env vars loaded from bashrc, keyboard interrupt working).

**Diagnosis:** Steady progress -- implementation was largely working.

**How close:** Close -- basic functionality verified but may have missed edge cases.

---

#### 19. llm-inference-batching-scheduler (1800s, 55 iterations)

**Task:** Generate optimized batching plans for LLM inference requests that meet cost/latency thresholds.

**What happened:** The agent was deeply engaged in optimizing the batching strategy, working through the cost model mathematics (prefill costs, decode costs, padding ratios, compile overhead). It was iterating on a dynamic programming approach to minimize cost while meeting latency constraints.

**Diagnosis:** Optimization loop -- the agent understood the problem well but kept iterating on the solution trying to meet all the performance thresholds simultaneously.

**How close:** Moderate -- had a working approach but metrics weren't below all thresholds.

---

#### 20. make-doom-for-mips (900s, 45 iterations)

**Task:** Cross-compile Doom to a MIPS ELF binary that works with a provided JS VM.

**What happened:** The agent was working on cross-compilation but 900s was insufficient for the MIPS cross-compilation toolchain setup and Doom build process.

**Diagnosis:** Inherently slow task -- cross-compilation setup and build takes significant time.

**How close:** Moderate -- progress on build but likely not complete.

---

#### 21. make-mips-interpreter (1800s, 71 iterations)

**Task:** Implement a MIPS interpreter in JavaScript (vm.js) that can run Doom.

**What happened:** The agent was analyzing the MIPS binary's memory layout (BSS section at 0x4003C6D0 = ~1GB), section headers, and symbol addresses (DG_ScreenBuffer, heap). Building a full MIPS interpreter for a Doom binary is extremely complex.

**Diagnosis:** Extremely complex task -- implementing a full MIPS interpreter with syscall handling is massive.

**How close:** Moderate -- significant analysis done but full interpreter unlikely complete.

---

#### 22. model-extraction-relu-logits (900s, 24 iterations)

**Task:** Extract weight matrix A1 from a one-layer ReLU network by querying forward().

**What happened:** The agent designed a correct approach: sample random lines through input space, find kinks (where ReLU activations change), compute gradient jumps at kinks to recover rows of A1. It was writing the `steal.py` implementation.

**Diagnosis:** Steady progress -- correct approach, implementation in progress.

**How close:** Close -- the algorithm was correct and being implemented.

---

#### 23. overfull-hbox (750s, 45 iterations)

**Task:** Fix overfull hbox warnings in LaTeX by replacing words with synonyms from synonyms.txt.

**What happened:** The agent was iteratively trying synonym substitutions to fix 7 overfull hbox warnings. Some were small (0.1pt) but one was massive (54.7pt from "creative temperament---"). The agent was making progress but the trial-and-error approach of substituting synonyms and recompiling was slow.

**Diagnosis:** Trial and error loop -- each attempt requires recompilation and checking. The short timeout (750s) was a factor.

**How close:** Moderate -- some warnings fixed but others remained.

---

#### 24. path-tracing (1800s, 74 iterations)

**Task:** Write a C program (image.c) that generates an image matching a reference PPM with 0.99 similarity.

**What happened:** The agent was reverse-engineering the reference image by analyzing pixel values to determine the scene geometry (sphere position, radius), lighting model (Lambertian + specular), and material properties. At iteration 74, it was computing N dot L and N dot H values to calibrate the shading model.

**Diagnosis:** Reverse engineering loop -- tedious pixel-by-pixel analysis to reconstruct a ray tracer.

**How close:** Moderate -- scene geometry identified but shading model not fully calibrated.

---

#### 25. polyglot-c-py (900s, 23 iterations)

**Task:** Write a single file that computes Fibonacci and works as both Python and C.

**What happened:** The agent actually had a working polyglot! Both Python and C produced correct results. However, it spent remaining iterations trying to suppress GCC warnings about unterminated strings in `#if 0` blocks. The warnings were cosmetic and didn't affect correctness.

**Diagnosis:** Perfectionism -- the solution worked but the agent wasted time on cosmetic warnings.

**How close:** Very close -- functionally complete, just had compiler warnings.

---

#### 26. polyglot-rust-c (900s, 19 iterations)

**Task:** Write a single file that computes Fibonacci and works as both Rust and C.

**What happened:** The agent spent all 19 iterations in extended reasoning about polyglot design strategies (using `#if 0` blocks, raw string literals, cfg attributes, macro tricks) without ever writing a working solution. The fundamental challenge of making code valid for both Rust and C++ compilers proved very difficult conceptually.

**Diagnosis:** Thinking loop -- deep reasoning about language syntax compatibility without producing working code.

**How close:** Not close -- no working solution produced.

---

#### 27. protein-assembly (1800s, 13 iterations -- EMPTY API LOOP)

**Task:** Design a fusion protein gBlock for Golden Gate cloning with FRET donor/acceptor pairs.

**What happened:** After only 13 productive iterations, the API started returning empty responses. The agent retried 551 times (retries up to 551+) with no content, burning all remaining timeout.

**Diagnosis:** **API empty response bug.** Similar to circuit-fibsqrt -- the model stopped producing responses and the retry loop consumed all time.

**How close:** Unknown -- very early in the task (only 13 iterations of progress).

---

#### 28. raman-fitting (900s, 27 iterations)

**Task:** Fit G and 2D peaks in a Raman spectroscopy dataset and output parameters to results.json.

**What happened:** The agent was analyzing the dataset structure (3565 data points, wavenumber range 1648-47183 cm^-1) and working on Lorentzian peak fitting. It was still in the data analysis phase when time ran out.

**Diagnosis:** Slow progress -- data analysis and understanding the spectrum took many iterations.

**How close:** Moderate -- data loaded and analyzed but fitting not completed.

---

#### 29. regex-chess (3600s, 23 iterations)

**Task:** Write a JSON file of regex/replacement pairs that generate all legal next chess positions from FEN.

**What happened:** The agent spent all iterations designing the regex-based chess engine architecture: FEN parsing into structured tags, digit expansion, castling rights normalization, move generation patterns. The reasoning was extremely detailed but no complete solution was produced.

**Diagnosis:** Thinking loop -- the task is extraordinarily complex (full chess move generation via regex only) and the agent got caught in design reasoning.

**How close:** Not close -- still in architectural design phase despite 3600s.

---

#### 30. regex-log (900s, 19 iterations)

**Task:** Write a regex that matches dates in YYYY-MM-DD format on lines containing IPv4 addresses.

**What happened:** The agent was working on the regex with various constraints (last date on line, valid date ranges, proper boundary matching).

**Diagnosis:** Steady progress but complex regex requirements.

**How close:** Moderate -- approach was correct but regex may not have been finalized.

---

#### 31. rstan-to-pystan (1800s, 71 iterations)

**Task:** Convert an R Stan script to PyStan 3.10.0 and run posterior sampling.

**What happened:** Many iterations were spent on installing PyStan 3.10.0 (which has complex dependencies) and debugging build/installation issues. The actual conversion work was delayed by infrastructure problems.

**Diagnosis:** Tooling/installation issues consumed most of the time budget.

**How close:** Moderate -- PyStan install issues may not have been fully resolved.

---

#### 32. sanitize-git-repo (900s, 44 iterations)

**Task:** Find and replace all API keys in a GitHub repository ("dclm") with placeholders.

**What happened:** The agent was scanning through the repository's git history looking for API keys (AWS keys, GitHub tokens). Searching through all commits of a large repo is time-consuming.

**Diagnosis:** Large search space -- scanning entire git history for secrets takes significant time.

**How close:** Moderate -- scanning was in progress but completion unknown.

---

#### 33. torch-pipeline-parallelism (900s, 35 iterations)

**Task:** Implement pipeline parallelism (AFAB scheduling) for a LlamaForCausalLM model.

**What happened:** The agent was implementing the pipeline parallelism with P2P communication ops, layer partitioning, and forward/backward pass scheduling.

**Diagnosis:** Complex distributed systems implementation within limited time.

**How close:** Moderate -- implementation was in progress.

---

#### 34. torch-tensor-parallelism (900s, 24 iterations)

**Task:** Implement ColumnParallelLinear and RowParallelLinear for tensor parallelism.

**What happened:** The agent was implementing the tensor parallelism classes with proper weight sharding and all-gather/all-reduce communication.

**Diagnosis:** Steady progress on a moderately complex distributed systems task.

**How close:** Moderate to close -- the concepts are well-understood but testing may not have been done.

---

#### 35. tune-mjcf (900s, 44 iterations)

**Task:** Tune a MuJoCo model file to reduce simulation time to 60% of original.

**What happened:** The agent was iteratively modifying MJCF parameters and measuring simulation time. This requires trial and error with recomputation.

**Diagnosis:** Trial and error optimization with each test requiring simulation time.

**How close:** Unknown -- depends on whether 60% threshold was reached.

---

#### 36. winning-avg-corewars (3600s, 155 iterations)

**Task:** Write a CoreWars program achieving a winning average against 5 classic warriors.

**What happened:** The agent was highly productive with 155 iterations, testing various warrior strategies against the 5 opponents. This is the most iterations of any timeout task, showing sustained progress.

**Diagnosis:** Iterative optimization -- the agent was actively testing and refining warriors but couldn't find a winning strategy in time.

**How close:** Unknown -- depends on final win rates.

---

#### 37. write-compressor (900s, 23 iterations)

**Task:** Create data.comp (<2500 bytes) that decompresses via a custom decomp.c to match data.txt.

**What happened:** The agent was analyzing the custom decompression format and implementing a matching compressor.

**Diagnosis:** Steady progress on reverse-engineering the compression format.

**How close:** Moderate -- format analysis done but compression implementation may not be complete.

---

## PART 2: WRONG ANSWER FAILURES (16 tasks)

These tasks completed (agent finished or was evaluated) but the verifier rejected the output.

---

#### 1. build-pov-ray (57 iterations, no FINAL set)

**Task:** Build POV-Ray 2.2 from source to `/usr/local/bin/povray`.

**What headlong did:** Downloaded POV-Ray 2.2 source archives from the official POV-Ray FTP server, extracted them, and attempted to compile. The agent found the correct source files (POVSRC.TAR.Z) and was working through the build process.

**Why it failed:** The verifier found:
1. `/usr/local/bin/povray` does not exist (FileNotFoundError)
2. Source file `file_id.diz` not found in `/app/povray-2.2` (wrong POV-Ray version)
3. All 3 tests failed

**Root cause:** The build process didn't complete successfully -- either compilation failed or the binary wasn't installed to the expected location. The agent was still working when evaluated.

---

#### 2. constraints-scheduling (30 iterations, FINAL set)

**Task:** Find a 1-hour meeting slot for Alice, Bob, and Carol during Jan 15-19, 2024 with complex availability constraints, output as ICS/VCALENDAR.

**What headlong did:** Generated a VCALENDAR file with the meeting.

**Why it failed:** The verifier checked for `SUMMARY` and `ATTENDEE` entries in the VEVENT block and found them missing: "Meeting VEVENT with required SUMMARY and ATTENDEE entries not found." Passed 2/3 tests (structure and format were correct).

**Root cause:** The ICS file was structurally valid but lacked required SUMMARY and ATTENDEE fields in the VEVENT block. A formatting issue in the output rather than a scheduling error.

---

#### 3. dna-insert (32 iterations, FINAL set)

**Task:** Design primers for inserting DNA into a vector.

**What headlong did:** Designed forward and reverse primers that met most requirements.

**Why it failed:** The melting temperature difference between forward and reverse primers was 5.44 degrees C, exceeding the 5-degree maximum: `assert abs(fwd_tm - rev_tm) <= 5`. Very close (off by 0.44 degrees).

**Root cause:** Marginally out-of-spec primer Tm difference. The agent was 0.44 degrees off the threshold.

---

#### 4. fix-code-vulnerability (36 iterations, FINAL set)

**Task:** Identify and fix a code vulnerability in Bottle web framework, produce a report.jsonl file.

**What headlong did:** Successfully identified CWE-93 (CRLF Injection), fixed the vulnerability in `bottle.py` by restoring control character validation in `_hkey()` and `_hval()`, and all 367 unit tests passed.

**Why it failed:** The verifier expected a `/app/report.jsonl` file documenting the vulnerability findings, which the agent didn't create. The fix itself was correct but the deliverable format was wrong.

**Root cause:** Missing output artifact -- the agent fixed the bug and made tests pass but didn't write the required report.jsonl file. Passed 3/6 tests (the code fix tests passed; the report file tests failed).

#### 5. gcode-to-text (15 iterations, no FINAL set)

**Task:** Interpret a G-code file for a Prusa MK4s and determine what text it prints. Write to `/app/out.txt`.

**What headlong did:** The agent got stuck in a **context retrieval loop**. On iteration 1, it read the prompt. On iterations 2-3, it ran `traj show` commands to try to re-read the prompt from its own trajectory history. Then on iterations 4-8+, it kept re-printing the task description without ever actually analyzing the G-code file. It never ran commands like `cat /app/text.gcode` or any G-code analysis. Eventually the `traj search` command on iteration 15 was killed by the shellm process.

**Why it failed:** `/app/out.txt` was never created. The verifier expected the file to contain the task's answer flag (value redacted — benchmark answer).

**Root cause:** **Agent got stuck in a meta-loop** trying to understand its own context via `traj show`/`traj search` rather than executing the actual task. This is a shellm agent behavior bug -- the agent should have been reading the G-code file, not its own trajectory.

#### 6. install-windows-3.11 (77 iterations, no FINAL set)

**Task:** Run Windows 3.11 for Workgroups in QEMU with VNC, web interface, and keyboard input support.

**What headlong did:** Worked on setting up QEMU with the Windows 3.11 disk image.

**Why it failed:** Three test failures:
1. Web interface not accessible (nginx not configured)
2. QEMU not running with correct parameters
3. Keyboard test failed: "Failed to send F1 (Help) via monitor"

**Root cause:** Complex multi-service setup (QEMU + VNC + nginx) wasn't fully configured. The QEMU instance wasn't accepting programmatic keyboard input through the monitor interface.

---

#### 7. largest-eigenval (32 iterations, no FINAL set)

**Task:** Optimize a function to find the dominant eigenvalue/eigenvector faster than NumPy's reference.

**What headlong did:** Implemented an optimized eigenvalue computation.

**Why it failed:** Failed 8 of 27 speedup tests. The implementation was faster than reference for small matrices but not for sizes 2-10. The margins were very tight: e.g., "0.000086 seconds/call > 0.000082 seconds/call" (only 5% slower). Passed 19/27 tests.

**Root cause:** Performance optimization not aggressive enough. The implementation was close but didn't consistently beat the reference for all matrix sizes.

---

#### 8. mteb-leaderboard (19 iterations, no FINAL set)

**Task:** Find the best embedding model on the Scandinavian MTEB leaderboard (as of Aug 2025), write name to `/app/result.txt`.

**What headlong did:** The agent's log is 11MB (very large), suggesting it downloaded extensive web content to research the answer.

**Why it failed:** `/app/result.txt` was never created. The agent researched the answer but didn't write the output file.

**Root cause:** Missing output file despite doing the research. The agent may have been still processing when evaluated.

---

#### 9. openssl-selfsigned-cert (27 iterations, FINAL set)

**Task:** Create a self-signed TLS certificate with specific requirements plus a Python verification script.

**What headlong did:** Created the certificate and key files with correct parameters. Passed 5 of 6 tests.

**Why it failed:** The Python verification script (`/app/ssl/verify_cert.py`) failed with a non-zero return code. The script existed but had an error when executed.

**Root cause:** Bug in the verification script. The certificate itself was correct (5/6 tests passed) but the Python script that verifies it had an issue.

---

#### 10. path-tracing-reverse (59 iterations, no FINAL set)

**Task:** Reverse-engineer a compiled binary (/app/mystery) and write an equivalent C program at `/app/mystery.c`.

**What headlong did:** Attempted to decompile and understand the mystery binary's behavior.

**Why it failed:** `/app/mystery.c` was never created. The verifier also tried to run the binary directly via chroot and that failed too.

**Root cause:** The agent didn't produce the required C source file. It spent iterations analyzing the binary but didn't write the reconstruction.

---

#### 11. qemu-alpine-ssh (2 iterations, no FINAL set)

**Task:** Start Alpine Linux in QEMU and configure SSH access on port 2222 with root/password123.

**What headlong did:** Only completed 2 iterations. On iteration 2, the agent ran a `traj show` command that appeared to hang (no output after the command).

**Why it failed:** SSH connection failed (return code 255 -- connection refused). The QEMU VM was never started.

**Root cause:** **Agent stalled on iteration 2.** The `traj show` command appears to have caused the agent to hang, consuming all remaining time. Only 670 lines of log output for the entire run.

---

#### 12. qemu-startup (2 iterations, no FINAL set)

**Task:** Start Alpine Linux in QEMU accessible via telnet on port 6665.

**What headlong did:** Identical issue to qemu-alpine-ssh -- only 2 iterations, stalled on a `traj show` command.

**Why it failed:** `/tmp/data.txt` not found. QEMU was never started.

**Root cause:** **Agent stalled on iteration 2** with the same `traj show` hang pattern as qemu-alpine-ssh. Both tasks failed identically.

---

#### 13. sam-cell-seg (58 iterations, no FINAL set)

**Task:** Convert rectangular cell masks to polylines using MobileSAM for histopathology slides.

**What headlong did:** Used MobileSAM to segment cells and produced output. Passed 7 of 9 tests.

**Why it failed:** Two issues:
1. Polygon overlaps: some output polygons overlapped significantly (intersection/area ratio > 0.001)
2. Coordinate format: coords_x values were tuples instead of lists

**Root cause:** Minor output format issues. The segmentation worked but the coordinate formatting used tuples instead of lists, and some polygon boundaries overlapped slightly.

---

#### 14. train-fasttext (52 iterations, no FINAL set)

**Task:** Train a FastText model and achieve accuracy above 0.62 threshold.

**What headlong did:** Trained a FastText model that achieved 0.5428 accuracy. Passed 1 of 2 tests (model file exists).

**Why it failed:** Accuracy of 0.5428 was below the 0.62 threshold. The model was trained but not well enough.

**Root cause:** Insufficient model quality. The agent may not have had enough time for hyperparameter tuning or may have used suboptimal training parameters.

---

#### 15. video-processing (59 iterations, no FINAL set)

**Task:** Write `/app/jump_analyzer.py` that analyzes hurdle jump videos and outputs TOML metrics.

**What headlong did:** Worked on implementing the video analysis pipeline over 59 iterations.

**Why it failed:** `/app/jump_analyzer.py` was never created. All 3 tests failed with FileNotFoundError.

**Root cause:** The agent likely wrote the file to the wrong location or the file wasn't saved properly. 59 iterations suggests significant work was done but the final artifact wasn't in the expected path.

---

#### 16. vulnerable-secret (10 iterations, no FINAL set)

**Task:** Extract a secret key (FLAG{...}) from an executable at /app/vulnerable, write to /app/results.txt.

**What headlong did:** Installed gdb and objdump, started disassembling the binary. Was still in the installation phase (installing libc6-dbg, gdb dependencies) at the end of its log.

**Why it failed:** `/app/results.txt` was never created. The agent spent most of its time installing analysis tools.

**Root cause:** Too much time spent on tool installation, not enough on actual analysis. Only 10 iterations completed.

## PART 3: KEY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### Top Issues by Impact

1. **Thinking loops (7 timeouts):** The model gets caught in extended reasoning without executing code. This is the most common timeout pattern. Consider adding a mechanism to detect when the model has spent multiple consecutive iterations in pure reasoning without code execution.

2. **Missing output files (6 wrong answers):** The agent does significant work but fails to create the expected output file. This suggests the agent either writes to the wrong path, forgets to save final output, or the task completes before output is written.

3. **Empty API response loops (2 timeouts, ~1286 total retries):** Two tasks (circuit-fibsqrt, protein-assembly) burned their entire remaining timeout on empty API response retries. A cap on empty response retries or a backoff strategy would help.

4. **Agent stall on `traj show` / context retrieval loops (3 wrong answers):** Both QEMU tasks stalled on iteration 2 when the agent ran `traj show` -- a meta-command that apparently hangs. The gcode-to-text task got stuck in a loop of `traj show`/`traj search` commands trying to re-read its own prompt rather than doing the task. This is a shellm agent behavior issue.

5. **Inherently slow tasks (6 timeouts):** Tasks involving compilation, training, or large downloads often timeout simply because the operations take too long. More generous timeouts or pre-built environments could help.

6. **Close-but-wrong results (4 wrong answers):** Several tasks failed by narrow margins (Tm off by 0.44C, tuples vs lists, missing ATTENDEE field). Better self-verification before submitting could catch these.

7. **Verifier timeout (1 timeout):** filter-js-from-html completed but the verifier itself timed out. Not a headlong issue.

### Recommendations

- **Add empty-response retry cap:** Stop retrying after ~50 empty API responses and either error out or try a different approach.
- **Fix `traj show` hang and context loops:** The agent should not call `traj show` during evaluation, or the command should be non-blocking. Consider disabling or restricting trajectory inspection commands during benchmark evaluation to prevent the agent from getting stuck in meta-loops.
- **Encourage early output writing:** The agent should write partial results early and update them, rather than waiting until everything is complete.
- **Add thinking-loop detection:** If the model produces multiple consecutive iterations of pure reasoning with no bash execution, nudge it to start writing code.
- **Improve self-verification:** Before declaring FINAL, the agent should check that all required output files exist and match expected formats.
