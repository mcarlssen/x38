# `recap` — trajectory summarization with step references

Status: COMPLETE — bin/recap plus the web Recap tab/API (server.py, recap.tsx) implement the full design.

**Status:** Implemented
**Date:** 2026-07-17

## Problem

A living identity's mind log grows into thousands of steps (nick-web-2's
first day: 2,176 steps, of which 625 are `idle` ticks). The web dash lets
you *dig* — timeline, mind log, sub-trajectory views — but there was no way
to *grok*: "what has this agent been up to, at what altitude did its focus
move, and where in the log did the interesting things happen?"

`shellm-explore --report` is adjacent but wrong-shaped: it analyzes **run
trees** (a task run and its forks), produces free prose with no step
references, and slurps whole contexts into one prompt — none of which
scales to a long-lived mind log.

## Design

`bin/recap` is a small composable CLI in the standard shellm mold: reads
env (`TRAJ_DIR`/`TRAJ_ID`, so plain `recap` inside an identity shell
summarizes that identity's mind log), state is plain files, LLM access
goes through `llm`.

### Map-reduce over the log

1. **Filter.** Keep steps that carry narrative signal — `thought`,
   `action`, `observation`, `message`, `feedback`, `final`, `shellm-run`,
   `merge` — and drop `idle`, seed thoughts, and sub-run internals
   (`reasoning`, `shell-output`, `prompt`). Each kept step renders as one
   line: `[8-char-id] type(source): content…` (content truncated to 500
   chars). Rendering is NUL-safe and rides raw jsonl line numbers for the
   bookkeeping below.

2. **Map: windows → episodes.** The filtered stream is chunked into
   windows, and each window goes to the LLM (one call) which returns
   strict JSON: a title, a 2–4 sentence summary, 1–4 kebab-case themes,
   and 3–6 *notable steps* — each a step id that literally appears in the
   window plus a short note. One window = one **episode**, appended to
   `recap/episodes.jsonl` with provenance (source line range, first/last
   step ids and timestamps, model, created).

   **Window boundaries are gap-aware.** A window closes at the first of:

   - a **time gap** of ≥ `--gap-minutes` (default 30) before the next
     step, provided the window already has ≥10 steps — mind logs have
     natural sessions (agent stopped, overnight idle, between chats), and
     cutting there makes episodes read like chapters;
   - `--window` steps (default 100), the hard size cap;
   - ~60KB of rendered text (`RECAP_MAX_WINDOW_BYTES`), so a run of fat
     observations can't blow the token budget.

   Gap math converts each `ts` to UTC epoch-minutes by hand (jq
   arithmetic, days-from-civil) because mind logs mix timezones —
   inner_monologue stamps `+0800` while the actor stamps `+0000`, and
   naive string comparison would see 8-hour phantom gaps. Unparseable
   timestamps simply never trigger a gap cut. Cut points are
   deterministic functions of the data already seen, so incrementality
   is unaffected.

3. **Reduce: episodes → themes.** All episode summaries (not the raw log)
   go to the LLM once, returning an **arc** (1–2 narrative paragraphs) and
   3–8 **themes**, each with a description, the episodes it spans, and key
   step references borrowed from the episodes' notable steps. Written to
   `recap/themes.json`.

Step ids are the connective tissue: every claim in the output is anchored
to `[8-char id]` references that resolve in the web dash's mind log.

### Cache & incrementality

Everything lives under `<traj-dir>/recap/` next to `trajectory.jsonl`:

```
recap/
  episodes.jsonl   # one episode per line, append-only in the common case
  themes.json      # the reduction; rewritten whenever episodes change
  .lock            # mkdir-based mutex while a recap runs
```

The mind log grows continuously, so refresh must be cheap:

- Each episode records the raw jsonl line range it covers. A refresh
  resumes after the last episode's `raw_end_line` — **only new steps get
  summarized**.
- A trailing chunk smaller than the window becomes a **partial** episode
  if it has ≥15 steps (`--min-tail`), else it's deferred to the next
  refresh. On refresh, a partial tail episode is dropped and re-summarized
  from its recorded start line, so it fills out into a full window over
  time. Completed (non-partial) episodes are never re-summarized.
- The reduce step reruns only when episodes changed (or `themes.json` is
  missing). A refresh with no new steps makes zero LLM calls.
- `--rebuild` drops the cache and starts over (e.g. after a prompt or
  model change). `--cached` prints without any LLM access.

### Models

Map and reduce take separate models; **both default to the smart model**
(`RECAP_MODEL` → `SHELLM_MODEL`). The stages have different demands:

- *Map* is compression — high call volume (scales with log length
  forever), modest skill required. `RECAP_MAP_MODEL` / `--map-model`
  exists so it can be dropped to a cheap model if cost ever matters.
  Note that episodes are cached forever, so a cheap map model's output
  quality is locked in until a `--rebuild`.
- *Reduce* is synthesis — one call over a couple KB of episode summaries,
  and it produces the arc/themes you actually read first. Keep it smart
  (`RECAP_REDUCE_MODEL` / `--reduce-model` to override).

Cost intuition: a 2,000-step day ≈ 1,000 filtered steps ≈ 10 window calls
plus 1 reduce call — roughly 50k input tokens total, i.e. cents on a
Sonnet-class model.

### Concurrency & safety

- `mkdir recap/.lock` is the mutex (atomic on every filesystem); a lock
  older than 30 minutes is treated as a crash leftover and reclaimed.
- The trajectory itself is **never written** — recap appends no steps, so
  running dispatchers/thinkers see no new events and are unaffected.
  (Contrast `run-summary`, which is a step *in* the trajectory.)
- No other tool can mistake `recap/` for a trajectory: child-trajectory
  discovery follows `fork` steps and requires a `trajectory.jsonl`
  inside, and identity discovery prunes `trajectories/` entirely.
- Model output is validated as JSON (fence-stripped, one retry) before
  anything is written.

## Web dash integration

Standard shape: the CLI owns the logic, the web layer moves bytes.

- `GET /api/identities/{id}/recap` — serves the cached themes + episodes,
  plus `refreshing` (lock present) and `new_steps` (raw lines beyond what
  the recap covers, i.e. staleness). Works in read-only mode.
- `POST /api/identities/{id}/recap/refresh` — fire-and-forget `recap -q`
  with the identity's env (same pattern as thinker steps: it can run for
  minutes, so don't block the request; the client polls the GET).
  `{"rebuild": true}` for a full redo. 409 if a recap is already running;
  403 in read-only mode.
- **Recap tab** (between Timeline and Mind log): arc, theme cards,
  episode list. Every step reference is a chip linking to
  `/i/<id>/mindlog?step=<8-char-id>`; the mind log resolves the prefix
  against its steps, scrolls there and flashes a highlight. Action steps
  that triggered a shellm run render as the run group's header, so the
  deep link falls back to the triggered run's element.
- Refresh button = incremental; shift-click = rebuild. The page polls
  while `refreshing` and shows "N steps since" staleness.

## Format notes

- `episodes.jsonl` entry: `idx`, `raw_start_line`/`raw_end_line`,
  `first_step`/`last_step`, `first_ts`/`last_ts`, `n_steps`, `partial`,
  `model`, `created`, then the LLM fields `title`, `summary`, `themes[]`,
  `notable_steps[{step, note}]`.
- `themes.json`: `generated_at`, `model`, `episodes` (count),
  `raw_end_line`, `total_lines`, `arc`, `themes[{name, description,
  episodes[], key_steps[{step, note}]}]`.
- Since the cache lives under `trajectories/`, `identity export` carries
  recaps with the identity; import needs no special handling.

## Testing

- `tests/test_recap.sh` (25 checks) stubs `llm` with canned JSON and
  exercises the real filtering/windowing/caching machinery: idle+seed
  exclusion, window math, partial-tail lifecycle, incremental no-op, JSON
  output, rebuild, locking.
- `web/tests/test_recap_api.py` covers cache serving, staleness,
  refreshing flag, fire-and-forget CLI invocation, lock conflict (409),
  and read-only gating.

## Future directions

- **Recap-on-cadence thinker**: a thinker that runs `recap -q` after every
  N steps so the tab is always fresh (recap adds no trajectory steps, so
  this can't feed back into dispatch).
- **Self-context**: feed `recap --cached --json` back to the agent — a
  cheap autobiographical memory layer for "what have I been doing this
  week?" (very Headlong: the recap is a compressed self-narrative).
- **Hierarchical reduce**: when episodes number in the hundreds, add a
  second map level (episode groups → chapters) before the theme reduce.
- **Semantic window boundaries**: gap-aware cutting covers the natural
  seams; LLM-chosen or embedding-based cut points would add calls and
  complexity for marginal gain, since the reduce already smooths over
  imperfect boundaries. Revisit only if episode titles feel consistently
  mid-thought.
- **Sub-trajectory recaps**: the tool already takes any trajectory id;
  the web tab currently only surfaces the root mind log.
