# headlong-slack-bridge

A Slack Socket Mode bridge that connects one Headlong identity to a Slack
workspace. Org members DM the bot or @mention it in channels; messages land
in the identity's mind log as `message` steps, and the identity's replies
are posted back to the right conversation.

## How it works

```
Slack <=(Socket Mode websocket)=> headlong-slack-bridge
    inbound:  event -> from_name "slack-<user>-<channel>[-<thread_ts>]"
              -> POST <web>/api/identities/<id>/chat
    outbound: tail trajectory.jsonl -> message steps where from=<identity>
              and to=slack-* -> chat.postMessage(channel, thread_ts)
```

The Slack conversation is encoded into the chat `from` name, which the
reply path returns as `to` — so no trajectory schema changes and no agent
changes are needed. Channel replies always go in-thread; DM replies go top
level. The bridge is a pure client of the existing web API and trajectory
format.

## Running

```bash
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...     # see "Slack app lifecycle" below
export SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-...
export HEADLONG_SLACK_IDENTITY=ada    # optional; defaults to the `default`
                                      # identity link (legacy SHELLM_SLACK_IDENTITY
                                      # still honored)
tools/headlong-slack-bridge [ROOT]      # ROOT = serve root, default repo root
```

The launcher loads `<checkout>/.env` and then `$HEADLONG_HOME/.env` (default
`~/.headlong/.env`), the same two files `persona` and `llm` read, so the
tokens can live in an env file instead of the calling shell. Anything already
exported wins, which is what keeps systemd's `EnvironmentFile` and `slack run`
in charge where they are used.

The identity must exist (`identity new <name>`) with a running dispatcher
(`thinkers start monolith responder`), and headlong-web must be serving the same root
(default `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, override with `HEADLONG_WEB_URL`; legacy `SHELLM_WEB_URL` still honored).

Socket Mode is outbound-only: no public endpoint, works behind NAT, and
keeps the zero-ingress deploy design. On a deployed box both the bridge and
the web server run as systemd units (`deploy/headlong-slack-bridge.service`,
`deploy/headlong-web.service`); `deploy/terraform-slack/` is the stack Laude
runs its own Slack-connected agent on.

Other settings: `HEADLONG_SLACK_STATE_DIR`, legacy `SHELLM_SLACK_STATE_DIR`
(cursor + thread state, default
`<identity>/run/slack-bridge/`), `SLACK_THREAD_FOLLOWUPS=1` (answer
un-mentioned replies in threads the bot is already part of).

For the end-to-end procedure we used to install our agent, Audel, into a
workspace on that stack (Slack app, tokens, SSM env, rebuild, verification),
see [PLAYBOOK.md](PLAYBOOK.md).

## Slack app lifecycle (Slack CLI)

`manifest.json` in this directory is the app's source of truth; manage the
Slack-side lifecycle with the [Slack CLI](https://docs.slack.dev/tools/slack-cli/)
from this directory:

```bash
cd slack
slack login                      # once per developer
slack app link --environment deployed   # once: attach the workspace app (or
                                        # let the CLI create it from manifest.json)
slack manifest validate          # after editing manifest.json
slack app install --environment deployed  # push manifest + reinstall (new scopes)
slack run                        # local dev: CLI-managed dev app + tokens,
                                 # runs the bridge against the repo root
```

Scope changes become: edit `manifest.json` → `slack manifest validate` →
`slack app install`. Production still uses the long-lived `xoxb-`/`xapp-`
tokens from app settings, stored in the box's SSM env parameter — the CLI
does not replace that step (app-level tokens are minted once under Basic
Information → App-Level Tokens, scope `connections:write`). Box-side day-2
(deploys, restarts) stays with `deploy/scripts/*`.

## Tests

```bash
uv run --project slack pytest slack/tests
```

## Security notes

Read this before widening beyond a pilot channel.

- **Workspace membership is the only gate.** Anyone in the workspace can
  message the bot, and the agent can run arbitrary bash on its box with its
  API keys. Mitigations: dedicated burnable instance, zero inbound network
  access, its own spend-capped LLM key, dash behind Cloudflare Access.
- **Prompt injection.** Slack message content (including pasted/forwarded
  text) flows straight into the agent's context. Treat anything the bot is
  told as potentially adversarial input.
- **Exfiltration.** The box allows all egress; a successfully injected
  agent could send secrets out. Keep only the secrets this box needs in its
  env.
- **One shared mind.** All conversations interleave in a single mind log.
  Anything one person tells the identity may surface in replies to others.
  Do not tell it secrets you would not post in a public channel.
