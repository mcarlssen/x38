# Renaming a unit is easy; the danger is the places that only *match a
# string* against the unit name and therefore keep running while quietly
# doing nothing. The 2026-08-12 self-kill happened through exactly such a
# blind spot, and the 2026-08-19 rename could have reopened it. See
# deploy/MIGRATIONS.md.

# These assertions are deliberately derived from the shipped unit FILES, so
# renaming a unit without updating its dependents fails here instead of in
# production.
