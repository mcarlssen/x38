# tests/test_explore_report_argv.sh — the report prompt stays off argv.
#
# Usage: tests/test_explore_report_argv.sh
#
# `shellm-explore --report` builds a prompt out of every run's context in the
# tree. Nothing that can hold it may travel through argv: Linux caps a single
# argument at 128 KiB and macOS caps total argv at 1 MiB, so a tree with a
# large recorded command used to die with "Argument list too long" (rc=126)
# before the model was ever called.
#
# The fixture is one run whose `command` holds a 200 KiB inline prompt — the
# same shape that put --prompt-file into bin/shellm. `llm` is stubbed and
# reports what it was handed, so the check is platform-independent: the
# prompt arrives on stdin and argv stays small.
