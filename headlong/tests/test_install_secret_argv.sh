# tests/test_install_secret_argv.sh — the container install keeps API keys off
# the docker command line.
#
# install.sh forwards a key and the interview answers into the container it
# starts. A value passed as `-e VAR=value` is an argument of the docker client,
# so it is readable from `ps` by any other local user for as long as that
# process lives; tests/test_var_secrets.sh already pins the same rule for the
# shellm path, and thinkers/_lib/common.sh already forwards keys by bare name
# for the same reason. Keys therefore go by NAME, which requires them to be exported, and
# the non-secret answers stay inline because two of them (HEADLONG_REPO,
# HEADLONG_BRANCH) are assigned by install.sh without export and a bare name
# would silently forward nothing.
