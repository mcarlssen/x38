#
# start: source the root .env and the identity, stop any stale dispatcher
# (wherever it lives — the ownership token makes old instances exit), then
# start every enabled thinker by name. Named start matters: the CLI's bare
# start only arms the dispatcher, while named start also kicks each thinker
# once so the mind actually wakes up (same reason the dash expands "start
# all" to explicit names, web/src/headlong_web/server.py).
#
# stop: drain stop, then wait for in-flight steps to finish so systemd's
# final cgroup sweep (KillMode=control-group) reaps only what refused to
# drain. Budget stays under the unit's TimeoutStopSec.
