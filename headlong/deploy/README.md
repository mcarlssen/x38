# deploy/

Everything for running an agent on a dedicated box: systemd units for
the thinkers, bridges, and dashboard, the `setup.sh` and `update.sh`
scripts, terraform for the AWS infrastructure, and the operational
scripts in `scripts/` (pulling the box's commits, usage, and metrics).

Two things live side by side here. The reusable parts are `terraform/`,
`setup.sh`, `update.sh`, the systemd units, and [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md),
which walks through standing up your own box. The Laude-specific parts
are `terraform-slack/` (our Slack-connected box, with our values baked
in), `scripts/audel-*` (operator scripts for that one instance), and
`slack-persona.md`; they are here for the record and as worked examples.

Start with [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md). [MIGRATIONS.md](MIGRATIONS.md) is the
playbook for structural changes on a box that is running a live mind,
and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) covers the box's security posture.
