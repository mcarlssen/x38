# Security posture of the chat integrations

This doc summarizes how each way of talking to a Headlong identity is
secured. It covers the Slack bridge (`slack/`), the phone chat PWA
(`web/`, served behind Cloudflare Access), and the Telegram bridge
(`telegram/`). Read
this before widening access to any of them.

## What all three share

The identity is an agent that runs arbitrary bash on its box with its
API keys, and every message a person sends goes straight into the
agent's context. Prompt injection is therefore always possible, from any
channel, and the defenses are the same everywhere:

- The box is dedicated and burnable, with zero inbound network access.
  All three integrations dial out (a Socket Mode websocket, a Cloudflare
  tunnel, and Telegram long polling), so nothing listens.
- The LLM key is dedicated to the box and spend capped.
- The box holds only the secrets it needs, because it allows all
  outbound traffic and an injected agent could send those secrets out.
- All conversations share one mind log. Anything one person tells the
  identity may surface in replies to anyone else, on any channel. Do
  not tell it secrets you would not post in a public channel.

Each channel is one message namespace in the mind log (`slack-*`,
`pwa-*`, `telegram-*`). Each bridge only forwards replies addressed to
its own namespace, so the channels cannot leak into each other's
transport, though the shared mind means content can still cross.

Each bridge has a kill switch that mutes the channel without touching
the agent. For Slack it is `systemctl stop headlong-slack-bridge`, for the
phone chat it is disabling the Cloudflare Access app, and for Telegram
it is `systemctl stop headlong-telegram-bridge`.

## Slack

Who can talk to the identity. Anyone in the Slack workspace the app is
installed in, by DM or by mention. Workspace membership is the only gate, and the
bridge does not have its own allowlist.

How it connects. The bridge holds two long-lived Slack tokens and opens
an outbound Socket Mode websocket. The tokens live in the box's root
`.env`, which comes from an SSM parameter and survives rebuilds.

Known gaps. The root `.env` is readable by the `shellm` user, which is
the user the agent runs as, so an injected agent can read the Slack
tokens and post as the bot anywhere the bot is installed. The Telegram
bridge avoids the same gap by design (see below), and moving the Slack
tokens out of the shared `.env` the same way would close it.

## Phone chat PWA

Who can talk to the identity. Only people who pass the Cloudflare Access
app in front of the chat domain. Access requires Google SSO or a one
time code, and the allowlist is the operator's email plus, optionally,
an email domain (`allowed_emails` / `allowed_email_domains` in the terraform
stack). A second, path-scoped Access app bypasses login only for the app
manifest and icons, which Android fetches without cookies during
install.

How it connects. The box reaches Cloudflare through an outbound tunnel.
Messages arrive over the same web API the bridges use, under `pwa-*`
sender names that the Slack bridge never forwards.

Push notifications. The push subscription store and the VAPID keys live
on the box, and only `pwa-*` names can subscribe. The keys die with the
box, and phones resubscribe on the next launch.

Known gaps. If an email domain is allowed, anyone with an account in
that domain can reach the chat; that is the intended trust circle. The push files are readable by the
agent's user, but they only allow sending notifications to subscribed
phones, not reading anything.

## Telegram

Who can talk to the identity. Only users on the bridge's allowlist.
Anyone on Earth can message a Telegram bot, so the bridge drops unknown
senders before their text reaches the mind log, and it stays silent
toward them so probing the bot confirms nothing. The admin approves or
denies senders from their own Telegram chat, and gets at most one prompt
per unknown sender per day.

The allowlist gates both directions. Replies addressed to unapproved
users are dropped, so an injected agent cannot use the bridge to carry
data out to an arbitrary chat.

Scope limits. The bridge is DM only and text only. It leaves any group
it is added to, because the allowlist cannot control who is in a group,
and it drops media, so nothing gets downloaded onto the box.

How it connects. The bridge long polls the Telegram API outbound. The
bot token lives in `/etc/shellm/telegram.env`, which is root owned with
mode 600, and only systemd reads it. The bridge runs as its own user
(`shellm-telegram`) rather than as the agent's user, because processes
with the same uid can read each other's environment. The allowlist and
cursors live in `/var/lib/shellm-telegram`, which the agent's user
cannot write, so an injected agent cannot approve an attacker.

Known gaps. The env file does not survive an instance rebuild and must
be recreated by hand. A leaked bot token would let an attacker
impersonate the bot to approved users and race the bridge for incoming
messages. Telegram bot chats are not end to end encrypted, so Telegram's
servers see all content. There is also a `skills/telegram` skill that
teaches the agent to drive the Telegram API with curl. Giving the agent
the bridge's bot token would undo the token isolation, so if the agent
should have Telegram access of its own, use a separate bot and token.

| Outbound reply check | None | Not needed (pull) | Allowlist |
| Survives rebuild | Yes (SSM parameter) | Keys regenerate | No (recreate env file) |
| Kill switch | Stop bridge unit | Disable Access app | Stop bridge unit |
